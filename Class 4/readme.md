# Project Rules

- The project must be done using flexbox, as much as you can.
- You can use bootstrap grid (ONLY GRID), it's not mandatory.
- All of the images are sliced out and you can find them in the images folder for every project.
- The project MUST be responsive.
- All of the icons in the project need to be added using [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/), or you can download them by searching each icon on [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/).
- If you have any questions, please, send me an email.
- Durring the classes, I will be working on Project 05. Please download that folder aswell.
